            <p>Lipstick is a cosmetic product used to apply coloration and texture to lips, often made of wax and oil. Different pigments are used to produce color, and minerals such as silica may be used to provide texture.</p>

When determining the quality of your brush, look for soft bristles that don't feel frayed or ragged.</p>
